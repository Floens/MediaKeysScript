### MediaKeysScript
Script for controlling media keys with AutoHotkey

It uses the grave accent (``` ` ```) in combination with some other key to control volume, skip tracks, pause/play, mute and selecting the default audio device.
And as a bonus ``` ` + enter``` centers the current window.
See the script for the combinations.
